## Introduction

AI development is moving fast and it is hard to keep a handle on all the resources available. There are also many facets to the discussion surrounding AI since it is not simply a computer science but is a mainstream philosophical discussion at this point. This set of bookmarks and references are intended to provide resources for both the technical introduction but also associated discussions of rationality and the nature of intelligence. It should go without saying that it is incomplete and is a list of people and information that I personally find useful. I am always looking for new resources and content to absorb in this field so please DM me any other ideas on Twitter: [@Matt_Keathley](https://twitter.com/Matt_Keathley)

## Training Resources

- Brilliantâ€™s Intro to Neural Nets: [https://brilliant.org/courses/intro-neural-networks](https://brilliant.org/courses/intro-neural-networks)
    - This is one of the best resources for those with zero prior knowledge. They teach through hands-on interaction versus raw math which makes it ideal for those wanting to have intuition about how it works.

## Blogs

- LessWrong: [https://www.lesswrong.com/](https://www.lesswrong.com/)
    - This is a blog/community that has been around since the early 00s that is focused on rationality and AI. I've notice that it is referenced or discussed many other places so it's a good place to keep pulse. But it's a lot to tackle.
    - New Users Guide: [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LbbrnRvc9QwjJeics/new-user-s-guide-to-lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LbbrnRvc9QwjJeics/new-user-s-guide-to-lesswrong)
    - AI Tag: [https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai)
- Star Slate Codex (SSC): [https://slatestarcodex.com/](https://slatestarcodex.com/) (which is now known as Astral Codex Ten)
- Astral Codex Ten: [https://astralcodexten.substack.com/](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)
    - This is a commonly referenced rationality/effective altruism blog that includes AI content.

## Videos Worth Watching

- Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)
    - Worth noting that this is from Andrej Karpathy who was director of AI at Tesla and now works for OpenAI. He genuinely builds a model from complete scratch so if you want to see what math goes into it this is the place. But it gets tough towards the middle.
- George Hotz interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNrTrx42DGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNrTrx42DGQ)
- Eliezer Yudkowsky interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaTRHFaaPG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaTRHFaaPG8)
    - These are both fascinating interviews on the state of AI and alignment problems. They are long but well worth the time. Not as technical but more fun.
