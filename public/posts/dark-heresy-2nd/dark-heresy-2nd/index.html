<p>üó°Ô∏è The system includes a variety of compendium packs, such as weapons, weapon mods, talents, armor, psychic abilities, ammunition, tools, traits, attack specials (toxic, corrosive, etc.), and consumables and drugs.</p>
<p>üí™ During character creation, there are automated bonuses for backgrounds, roles, and elite advances.</p>
<p>üß∞ You can easily manage your inventory by dragging and dropping items, such as weapon mods and custom ammunition to build weapons, or storing items in a location on your ship to reduce encumbrance.</p>
<p>üî´ You can also drag weapons and skills to the macro bar for easy access, and the system offers automation support for weapon specials, most talents, attack types, and custom ammunition when you attack. Modifiers like distance and character size are automatically taken into account when targeting an attack.</p>

<li>I liked the layout of the WH4e sheet on Roll20 and tried to mimic that where possible. Thanks to the authors for that inspiration.</li>
<li>I studied the original DH2e Foundry VTT project by moo-man. I ended up not using much from there but learned a lot about Foundry. I appreciate the head start!</li>
<li>My tabletop group for play testing and feedback.</li>
