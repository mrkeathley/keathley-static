## Beliefs

We enter the world with nothing and exit with nothing. Once you understand that and stop trying to hold onto things you will be able to enjoy them.

Simply enjoy the monotony of each moment. That’s where joy can be found.

When you pull the curtain back on who and what is running the world it’s a mirror.

Pursue maximum agency. There are those that think life happens to them and then those that break the fiction and become autonomous.

Reality is networks. Jumbles of systems in a connected and often beautiful chaos.

Simplicity over complexity. Freedom over centralization.

I love when I have earbuds in and the perfect song comes on to describe the scenery outside my window while driving.
