			<p>Deana and I met in 2006 when I had just moved to North Carolina following Hurricane Katrina. I was at a friend’s apartment to play board games and she was there to borrow a movie. I added her on AIM (rest in peace) and we started talking there. I still have the transcript of those couple months of conversations and it’s hilarious. We would start dating almost a month after that exactly on my birthday. And then got married the following year on this day in July 2007.</p>
<p>Our early years were difficult due primarily to me. I was immature and selfish much of the time although I couldn’t see it. But we were not alone. We had our church and friends and family who really bolstered our marriage and helped us navigate those hard times. They showed me places that needed correction and gave me space to mature. Marriages shouldn’t occur in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Now we are 16 years later today and it’s hard to describe our current scenario since I am blessed beyond measure. I have a beautiful wife who is a help and friend. She has been patient and persistent to make our home one that is a great place to be. We have four crazy kids that we get to parent together. The joy of parenting is a real thing. And I can’t think of anywhere else I would rather be than where I am right now.</p>
<p>Happy Anniversary Deana!</p>
