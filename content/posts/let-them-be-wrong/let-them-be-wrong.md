As my children have grown there have been many opportunities to pass on wisdom that I have learned. I used to believe the limiting factor to this endeavor was simply interest and the time required through conversation to have discussions. But what is immediately apparent when dealing with a child or young teen is that there are sometimes intellectual limitations to their understanding. Although an argument can be made as comprehensively and coherently as possible an impasse can be found when the neurons in the brain simply are not yet developed. 

I donâ€™t think this should be too surprising since we experience it with regularity. A problem from work can be tackled with fervent zeal but the solution not found until a full night's rest allows the brain to provide physical neurological connections that were previously missing. If this is true of children and ourselves then we should expect the same experience when having discussions with others. There will be times that a truth cannot be understood without the neurological contextual structure in which to hold it. If this is true then it explains much of the failure of debate to solve the world's problems. Logic and discussion can plant the seeds of truth but if the intellectual soil is rocky or infertile it can be difficult to see fruit from these endeavors.
