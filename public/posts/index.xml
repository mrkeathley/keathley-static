      <description>The initial release of a Foundry VTT module for Dark Heresy 2nd edition has been released.
This system is intended to provide extensive support for character sheets, compendium packs, and automated management. The existing system listed on Foundry was character sheet only and thus this system was created to facilitate the automation features I desired.
Install Go to the setup page and choose Game Systems. Click the Install System button, and paste in this manifest link.</description>
